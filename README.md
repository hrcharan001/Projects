# Monthly Work Schedule
## Project Overview
This project is an Excel-based Monthly Work Schedule system designed to plan, track, and validate employee shift allocations for an organization. It provides a clear day-wise and employee-wise view of shifts, highlights missing allocations, and ensures minimum staffing requirements are met.

The schedule is created for January 2026 and can be easily extended to other months with minimal changes.

## Project Objectives

-- To create a centralized shift planning system for employees
-- To ensure balanced allocation of Morning, Afternoon, and Night shifts
-- To automatically validate shift coverage per day
--To identify missing or insufficient shifts at a glance
--To improve operational efficiency and workforce planning

## Project Insights

-- Some days show "Missing" shift checks, indicating incomplete assignments
-- Sundays can have zero shifts, helping identify planned off-days
--Balanced distribution avoids overloading specific employees
--Visual formatting makes workforce gaps immediately noticeable
